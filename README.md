# MVC-Blog
A simple blog site following the MVC paradigm.

## Description
This project aims to create a simple web application in which a user can create an account and post tech related blog posts. It follows the MVC paradigm (model, views, and controllers). The model provides the data which in this case, is the data relating to user account information, posts, and comments. The views is the web app interface with which the user interacts. The controller is the server side code that handles all HTTP requests, updating models, views, etc. Handlebars makes the web app dyanmic which is also part of the views. Not much styling was made besides default bootstrap for the HTML side. If given enough time, styling would be added to the site and tweaks to the mobile first design aspect. The function to edit exisitng user made posts does not currently work but is a future feature. 
## Installation

No need to install anything. Go to: [Heroku](https://pure-depths-01409-8304d9d8effa.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Create an account by clicking on the "signup" button. After that is done, you can create an account, create a new post, delete exisitng posts, and add comments to exisiting posts. Click the "account" button to create a new post. Deleting exisiting posts is working but editing exisiting posts is not currently. You can then add comments to an exisiting post by going to the homepage.
